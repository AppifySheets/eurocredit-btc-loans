## 2. Loan Parameters & Risk Management

### 2.1 Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios

| LTV Tier | Max LTV | Interest Rate | Margin Call | Liquidation |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Conservative** | 50% | 8% APR | 65% | 70% |
| **Standard** | 70% | 10% APR | 80% | 85% |
| **Premium** | 80% | 12% APR | 87% | 92% |

### 2.2 Margin Call & Liquidation Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Price Monitoring] --> B{LTV Check}
    B -->|LTV < Warning| C[Normal Operations]
    B -->|LTV >= Warning| D[Warning Alert]
    D --> E[Customer Notification]
    E --> F{Customer Action}
    F -->|Add Collateral| G[LTV Restored]
    F -->|Partial Repayment| G
    F -->|No Action 48hrs| H{LTV >= Critical?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Initiate Liquidation]
    H -->|No| J[Enhanced Monitoring]
    I --> K[Sell BTC Amount]
    K --> L[Repay Loan]
    L --> M[Return Excess to Customer]
```

### 2.3 Margin Call Triggers

#### Warning Levels (Customer Notification Required)
- **Level 1 Warning**: LTV reaches 65% (Conservative), 80% (Standard), 87% (Premium)
  - Email & SMS notification
  - 72-hour grace period
  - Options: Add collateral or partial repayment

#### Critical Levels (Immediate Action)
- **Level 2 Critical**: LTV reaches 68% (Conservative), 83% (Standard), 90% (Premium)
  - Urgent notification via all channels
  - 48-hour grace period
  - Daily follow-up calls

#### Liquidation Triggers
- **Automatic Liquidation**: LTV reaches 70% (Conservative), 85% (Standard), 92% (Premium)
  - Immediate partial liquidation to restore 10% buffer
  - Full liquidation if buffer cannot be maintained

### 2.4 Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Standard Loan
```
Initial Setup:
- BTC Price: $50,000
- Collateral: 1 BTC ($50,000)
- LTV: 70%
- Loan Amount: $35,000
- Interest: 10% APR

Price Drop Scenario:
- BTC drops to $43,750 (12.5% decrease)
- New LTV: 80% (Margin Call triggered)
- Customer must add 0.1 BTC or repay $5,000 within 72 hours
```

#### Scenario 2: Liquidation Example
```
If BTC drops to $41,176 (17.6% decrease):
- LTV reaches 85% (Liquidation trigger)
- MFO sells 0.15 BTC to restore LTV to 70%
- Customer retains 0.85 BTC in custody
- Loan amount reduced accordingly
```
