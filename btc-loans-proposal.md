- **Information Provided**: 
  - Bitcoin lending basics
  - LTV ratios available
  - Interest rates
  - Risk disclaimers

#### Step 2: Pre-Qualification
- Bitcoin holdings verification (minimum 0.1 BTC)
- Georgian residency confirmation
- Age verification (18+)
- Credit history review

#### Step 3: KYC/AML Process

### 1.3 Application to Disbursement Flow

**Process Description:** The customer submits a loan application to EuroCredit, who conducts KYC/AML verification. After the customer provides required documents, EuroCredit performs risk assessment and sends loan approval with terms. The customer signs the agreement and transfers BTC collateral to Coinbase. Once Coinbase confirms receipt, EuroCredit initiates fiat transfer through the bank, and the customer receives the loan funds.

## 2. Loan Parameters & Risk Management

### 2.1 Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios

| LTV Tier | Max LTV | Interest Rate | Margin Call | Liquidation |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Conservative** | 50% | 8% APR | 65% | 70% |
| **Standard** | 70% | 10% APR | 80% | 85% |
| **Premium** | 80% | 12% APR | 87% | 92% |

### 2.2 Margin Call & Liquidation Process

**Process Overview:** The system continuously monitors Bitcoin prices and checks LTV ratios. When LTV exceeds warning thresholds, customers are notified and given time to add collateral or make partial repayments. If no action is taken within 48 hours and LTV reaches critical levels, liquidation is initiated. The system sells the necessary BTC amount, repays the loan, and returns any excess to the customer.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Price Monitoring] --> B{LTV Check}
    B -->|LTV < Warning| C[Normal Operations]
    B -->|LTV >= Warning| D[Warning Alert]
    D --> E[Customer Notification]
    E --> F{Customer Action}
    F -->|Add Collateral| G[LTV Restored]
    F -->|Partial Repayment| G
    F -->|No Action 48hrs| H{LTV >= Critical?}

    H -->|No| J[Enhanced Monitoring]
    I --> K[Sell BTC Amount]
    K --> L[Repay Loan]
    L --> M[Return Excess to Customer]
```

### 2.3 Margin Call Triggers

#### Warning Levels (Customer Notification Required)
- **Level 1 Warning**: LTV reaches 65% (Conservative), 80% (Standard), 87% (Premium)
  - Email & SMS notification
  - 72-hour grace period
  - Options: Add collateral or partial repayment

#### Critical Levels (Immediate Action)
- **Level 2 Critical**: LTV reaches 68% (Conservative), 83% (Standard), 90% (Premium)
  - Urgent notification via all channels
  - 48-hour grace period
  - Daily follow-up calls

#### Liquidation Triggers
- **Automatic Liquidation**: LTV reaches 70% (Conservative), 85% (Standard), 92% (Premium)
  - Immediate partial liquidation to restore 10% buffer
  - Full liquidation if buffer cannot be maintained

### 2.4 Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Standard Loan
```
Initial Setup:
- BTC Price: $50,000
- Collateral: 1 BTC ($50,000)
- LTV: 70%
- Loan Amount: $35,000
- Interest: 10% APR

Price Drop Scenario:
- BTC drops to $43,750 (12.5% decrease)
- New LTV: 80% (Margin Call triggered)
- Customer must add 0.1 BTC or repay $5,000 within 72 hours
```

#### Scenario 2: Liquidation Example
```
If BTC drops to $41,176 (17.6% decrease):
- LTV reaches 85% (Liquidation trigger)
- MFO sells 0.15 BTC to restore LTV to 70%
- Customer retains 0.85 BTC in custody
- Loan amount reduced accordingly
```

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 System Components

**Architecture Overview:** The system consists of four main layers. The Customer Layer includes web portal, mobile app, and branch terminals. The EuroCredit Core System leverages Alta Software (already NBG-approved for EuroCredit's auto loans) as the loan management system, integrated with risk engine, price oracle, and notification services. External Services integrate with Coinbase Custody, price feeds, banking APIs, and SMS gateways. The Security Layer implements multi-signature wallets, HSM key storage, and comprehensive audit logging.

## 5. Regulatory Compliance Framework

### 5.1 National Bank of Georgia Requirements

#### Licensing & Registration
- MFO license modification for crypto-collateralized lending
- Custody partner registration
- Quarterly reporting obligations via Alta Software (existing NBG-approved reporting channel)

#### Consumer Protection Measures
1. **Clear Risk Disclosure**
   - Volatility warnings
   - Liquidation risk explanation
   - No deposit insurance disclaimer

2. **Cooling-Off Period**
   - 48-hour withdrawal right after agreement
   - Full refund of fees if cancelled

3. **Maximum Exposure Limits**
   - Single borrower: Max 5 BTC collateral
   - Portfolio limit: 20% of MFO's loan book

### 5.2 AML/KYC Compliance

**Compliance Flow:** Customer applications undergo risk assessment based on BTC amount. Low-risk customers (<0.5 BTC) receive standard KYC, medium-risk (0.5-2 BTC) require enhanced due diligence, and high-risk (>2 BTC) need additional source of funds verification. All customers are subject to ongoing monitoring, with suspicious activities reported to FMS and regular reviews for compliant accounts.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Customer Application] --> B{Risk Assessment}
    B -->|Low Risk<br/><0.5 BTC| C[Standard KYC]
    B -->|Medium Risk<br/>0.5-2 BTC| D[Enhanced Due Diligence]

## 6. Risk Mitigation Strategy

### 6.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Price Volatility** | High | High | Conservative LTV ratios, real-time monitoring |
| **Custody Failure** | Low | Critical | Insurance, multi-sig, backup custodian |
| **Regulatory Change** | Medium | High | Active engagement with NBG, flexible framework |
| **Cyber Security** | Medium | High | Cold storage, penetration testing, insurance |
| **Operational Error** | Medium | Medium | Dual approval, automated systems, training |
| **Liquidity Crisis** | Low | High | Credit lines, partial liquidation options |

### 6.2 Insurance Coverage

#### Required Policies
1. **Crime Insurance**: $5M minimum
2. **Cyber Insurance**: $10M minimum
3. **E&O Insurance**: $2M minimum

### Appendix D: Early Repayment Process

**Customer-Initiated Early Repayment**

#### Process Overview
Customers can repay their Bitcoin-backed loans early at any time without penalties. The process ensures immediate collateral release and proper settlement of all obligations.

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Repayment Initiation**
   - Customer logs into portal/app or visits branch
   - Requests early repayment quote
   - System calculates total amount due:
     - Outstanding principal
     - Accrued interest (pro-rated to current date)
     - No prepayment penalties

2. **Payment Execution**
   - Customer transfers funds via:
     - Bank transfer
     - Cash deposit at branch
     - Wire transfer for large amounts
   - System confirms payment receipt

3. **Collateral Release Process**
   ```
   Timeline: 2-4 hours after payment confirmation
   
   Step 1: Payment Verification (15 minutes)
   - Confirm full amount received
   - Update loan status to "Paid in Full"
   
   Step 2: Collateral Calculation (5 minutes)
   - Calculate exact BTC amount to release
   - Account for any partial liquidations
   - Generate release authorization
   
   Step 3: Multi-Signature Authorization (1-2 hours)
   - EuroCredit signs release transaction
   - Customer receives notification to co-sign
   - Transaction broadcast to Bitcoin network
   
   Step 4: Confirmation (1-2 hours)
   - Wait for 3 blockchain confirmations
   - Send final settlement statement
   - Archive loan documentation
   ```

4. **Settlement Documentation**
   - Final statement showing:
     - Total amount paid
     - Interest saved through early repayment
     - BTC returned to customer wallet
     - Transaction IDs for audit trail

#### Benefits of Early Repayment
- **No penalties**: Full flexibility to repay anytime
- **Interest savings**: Pay only for days used
- **Immediate collateral access**: BTC released within hours
- **Credit score improvement**: Positive reporting to credit bureaus

#### Example Calculation
```
Original Loan: $35,000
Term: 12 months at 10% APR
Repayment after 3 months:

Principal: $35,000
Interest (3 months): $875
Total Due: $35,875

Interest Saved: $2,625
BTC Released: Full collateral minus any liquidations
```
